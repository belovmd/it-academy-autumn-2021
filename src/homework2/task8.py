# TASK 1
# You are at the beginning of a password series. Every mission is based on the previous one.
# The missions that follow will become slightly more complex.
# In this mission, you need to create a password verification function.
# The verification condition is: the length should be bigger than 6.
# https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/acceptable-password-i/

# TASK 2
# You are given a string and you have to find its first word.
# This is a simplified version of the First Word mission, which can be solved later.
# The input string consists of only English letters and spaces.
# There arenâ€™t any spaces at the beginning and the end of the string.
# https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/first-word-simplified/

# TASK 3
# You should return a given string in reverse order.
# Input: A string.
# Output: A string.
# https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/backward-string/

string = str(input('Kindly input the string: '))
print(string[::-1])

# TASK 4
# You have a string that consist only of digits.
# You need to find how many zero digits ("0")
# are at the beginning of the given string.
# Input: A string, that consist of digits.
# beginning_zeros('001001') == 2
# beginning_zeros('0000') == 4

# TASK 4
# Find the nearest value to the given one.
# You are given a list of values as set form
# and a value for which you need to find the nearest one.
# nearest_value({4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 17}, 9) == 10
# nearest_value({4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 17}, 8) == 7
# https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/nearest-value/
