# TASK 1
# You are at the beginning of a password series. Every mission is based on the previous one.
# The missions that follow will become slightly more complex.
# In this mission, you need to create a password verification function.
# The verification condition is: the length should be bigger than 6.

# TASK 2
# You are given a string and you have to find its first word.
# This is a simplified version of the First Word mission, which can be solved later.
# The input string consists of only English letters and spaces.
# There arenâ€™t any spaces at the beginning and the end of the string.

# TASK 3
# The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open.
# They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members
# which category they will be placed.
# To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7.
# In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26;
# the better the player the lower the handicap.
# Input will consist of a list of lists containing two items each.
# Each list contains information for a single potential member.
# Information consists of an integer for the person's age and
# an integer for the person's handicap.

# TASK 4
# You have a string that consist only of digits.
# You need to find how many zero digits ("0")
# are at the beginning of the given string.
# Input: A string, that consist of digits.
